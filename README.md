## Overview
### Description
Helps you improve your vocabulary in an engaging manner through mini word games and challenges.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Education / Productivity
- **Mobile:** This app would be developed for mobile because it's meant to be a daily use app that can be accessed on the go. It can work on a computer but it would have less accessibility.
- **Story:** Improves vocabulary through engaging exercises and lets the user track their progress and score.
- **Market:** Students and users looking to learn or practice vocabulary and speech.
- **Habit:** This app will be used as often as the user wants but the app will provide a user challenge to encourage daily use.
- **Scope:** The app will start with simple vocabulary teaching and exercises at a level of the user's choice but it can be expanded to include user voice recognition and incorporate games and activities in a variety of languages.
